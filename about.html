        <!-- Our History -->
        <section>
            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>Sweetest Fills Bakery was founded in 2020 with one heartfelt mission: to fill every occasion with a touch of sweetness. What began as a small home-based business quickly became a local favourite, known for pastel-coloured designs, soft textures, and flavours that feel like a warm hug.</p>
            
            <p>Our founder, Phumelelo Ajetunmobi, started baking for friends and family, who encouraged her to share her talent with the community. 
                Starting with just a few cake orders per week, word quickly spread about the quality and beauty of our creations.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, our treats have been part of birthdays, weddings, baby showers, and everyday indulgences.
                 While we've grown from that initial home kitchen, we've never lost sight of our commitment to quality, creativity, and personal service.</p>
